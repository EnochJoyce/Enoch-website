    <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC (SIE) is a multinational video game and digital entertainment company owned by Sony Group Corporation. SIE primarily operates the PlayStation brand of video game consoles and products. In 1993, Sony Corporation (current Sony Group Corporation) and Sony Music Entertainment Japan jointly established Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (株式会社ソニー・コンピュータエンタテインメント, SCE) in Tokyo. SCE released the video game console PlayStation in Japan the following year and subsequently in the United States and Europe the year after. In 2010, SCE underwent a corporate split and established Sony Network Entertainment International (SNEI). SNEI provided gaming-related services through the PlayStation Network, including the sale of game titles and content on the PlayStation Store, as well as offering PlayStation Plus. In 2016, SCE and SNEI merged to form Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC, with its headquarters located in San Mateo, California, U.S.[3]

        Since the launch of the original PlayStation console in 1994, the company has been developing PlayStation home video game consoles, accessories and services. The company expanded from Japan into North America and Europe, where it founded the branches Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) in May 1995 (in Foster City, California) and Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE) in July 1995 (in Liverpool). The company quickly became Sony's main resource for research and development in video games and interactive entertainment. In April 2016, SCE and Sony Network Entertainment International was restructured and reorganized into Sony Interactive Entertainment, carrying over the operations and primary objectives from both companies. The same year, SIE LLC was established, with its headquarters in San Mateo, California.
        
    
        SIE currently has eight main headquarters around the world. They are as follows:
        
            Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC (San Mateo, California) — the global and regional headquarters for North America and Latin America (except Cuba and the Caribbean countries)
            Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe Limited (London, England) — controls operations in Europe, South Africa, Middle East, India, Turkey, Australia and New Zealand (except Russia, Egypt, Belarus and Baltic countries)
            Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. and Sony Interactive Entertainment Japan Asia (Minato, Tokyo, Japan) — controls operations in Japan and was also formerly the regional headquarters for Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.
            Sony Interactive Entertainment Korea (Seoul, South Korea) — controls South Korean operations
