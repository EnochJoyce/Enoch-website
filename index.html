        <h2>Battle Field 4</h2>
        <img src="Battlefield.jpg">
        <p>Battlefield 4 is a 2013 first-person shooter video game developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released in October and November for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and is the sequel to 2011's Battlefield 3, taking place six years later during the fictional "War of 2020".
 
            Battlefield 4 was met with positive reception for its multiplayer mode, gameplay and graphics, but was criticized for its single-player campaign and for numerous bugs and glitches in the multiplayer. It was a commercial success, selling over seven million copies.[4] The next game in the franchise, Battlefield 1, was released in 2016.

        <h2>Roblox</h2>
        <img src="Roblox.png">
        <p>How does it work?
         It is an entirely online, social game: everything you play has been built by someone else. Naturally, this means Roblox is absolutely full of knock-off user-created riffs on popular games such as Pokémon, Five Nights at Freddy’s and Mario. There is endless content, which helps explain why it is so enduringly popular. One of the most beloved Roblox games right now is a cops-and-robbers riff on Grand Theft Auto called Prison Break, where you either join a team of prisoners trying to escape jail and rob banks, or a team of police trying to arrest them. Because you can technically create anything in Roblox, there are algorithms and moderators beating back the inevitable swearwords and swastikas, but they are not always successful.

        <img src="Lost planet.png">

The game is the prequel to Lost Planet: Extreme Condition and Lost Planet 2 and takes place on the same planet of E.D.N. III. The game takes a more story-driven narrative approach to the campaign similar to the first game. Unlike the previous games in the series, which were developed internally by Capcom, the game was developed externally by Spark Unlimited with Matt Sophos serving as game director, though series creator Kenji Oguro was still attached as franchise creative director.
